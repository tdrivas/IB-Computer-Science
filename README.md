Welcome to the **IB Computer Science (new syllabus 2025)** Python, AI and Database learning repository!  
This repo guides students step-by-step from **zero programming experience** to building **fully functional software solutions** that meet the **Internal Assessment (IA)** and **Paper 1/2** expectations.

👩‍💻 **Designed for students and teachers** following the *IB Diploma Programme Computer Science* curriculum (first exams May 2027).  
🧠 **Built with understanding in mind:** every notebook, exercise, and project encourages curiosity, reasoning, and reflection — not memorization.

---

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

Programming is not just about typing code — it’s about **thinking clearly**.  
This repository helps you:
- Understand **how computers “think”** and how to **translate ideas into code**.
- Solve real-world problems using **Python** and **computational thinking**.
- Build confidence for **Paper 1**, **Paper 2**, and your **Internal Assessment (IA)**.
- Connect coding to **AI, data science, and ethics** — topics central to the new IB syllabus.

## 🔑 IB Alignment

- **Theme 1:** Computational Thinking Practices → Units 1–4  
- **Theme 2:** Programming & Development → Units 3–7  
- **Theme 3:** Global Impact of Computing → Units 8–9  
- **Internal Assessment (IA):** Unit 10  

Each lesson aligns with **Assessment Objectives AO1–AO4**:
- AO1: Understand
- AO2: Apply
- AO3: Analyse & Evaluate
- AO4: Design & Develop

## 🧰 How to Use

1. **Start** from `01_python_basics` and move forward sequentially.  
2. Open `.ipynb` notebooks in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
3. Try exercises before viewing solutions.  
4. Explore the **mini-projects** and **reflection questions** at the end of each unit.

> 💡 Tip: Each folder includes a `README.md` written in student-friendly language to guide your journey.
