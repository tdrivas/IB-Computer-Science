# 🌍 IB Computer Science 2025 – AI, Databases and Python Programming Journey

Welcome to the **IB Computer Science (new syllabus 2025)** Python learning repository!  
This repo guides students step-by-step from **zero programming experience** to building **fully functional software solutions** that meet the **Internal Assessment (IA)** and **Paper 1/2** expectations.

👩‍💻 **Designed for students and teachers** following the *IB Diploma Programme Computer Science* curriculum (first exams May 2025).  
🧠 **Built with understanding in mind:** every notebook, exercise, and project encourages curiosity, reasoning, and reflection — not memorization.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

Programming is not just about typing code — it’s about **thinking clearly**.  
This repository helps you:
- Understand **how computers “think”** and how to **translate ideas into code**.
- Solve real-world problems using **Python** and **computational thinking**.
- Build confidence for **Paper 1**, **Paper 2**, and your **Internal Assessment (IA)**.
- Connect coding to **AI, data science, and ethics** — topics central to the new IB syllabus.
